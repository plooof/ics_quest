# Personal Fitness Tracker
### Justin Angue

As part of the Mary Ward experience, Quest units are a common thing to come by. Quest units are assignments in which students are tasked to employ what they have learned in their courses thusfar, and show off this knowledge to their corresponding teachers.

As part of the ICS3U1 course, we were tasked to create a Python 3 program that showcases what we have learned thusfar in the course.

For my Quest unit, I decided to join the forces between programming and physical education. Recently, I was speaking to a physical education teacher at Ward who mentioned their interest in creating an application that could help students track their personal fitness achievements.
